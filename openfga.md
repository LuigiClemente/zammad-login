You can adapt a similar approach to manage invitation counts for users, using conditional relationships in OpenFGA and updating them from your Camunda workflow. Here’s how it could work:

1. **Defining the Concept of "Invitations Allowed" as a Condition**:  
   Instead of a time-based condition (like in the provided example with `non_expired_grant`), you would define a condition that depends on the number of remaining invitations. For example, the family plan admin relationship grants the user permission to send invitations. We can imagine a condition `has_invitations_left` that checks if the number of allowed invitations is greater than zero.

   For example, you might define a model where a user is granted the right to "invite" on your application object if they still have invitations left:
   ```  
   model
     schema 1.1

   type user

   type application
     relations
       define can_invite: [user with has_invitations_left]

   condition has_invitations_left(remaining_invitations: int) {
     remaining_invitations > 0
   }
   ```

   In this model, any `can_invite` relationship must be assigned with a condition that ensures the user has a positive number of invitations left.

2. **Storing and Updating the Condition Context**:  
   When you write the relationship tuple for `application:my_app#can_invite@user:alice`, you provide the condition context, for example:
   ```js
   await fgaClient.write({
     writes: [
       {
         user: "user:alice",
         relation: "can_invite",
         object: "application:my_app",
         condition: {
           name: "has_invitations_left",
           context: { "remaining_invitations": "5" }
         }
       }
     ]
   });
   ```

   This means that user `alice` initially has 5 invitations left. The condition says that access to the "invite" action is only allowed if `remaining_invitations > 0`.

3. **Integration with Camunda**:  
   Your Camunda node.js workflow can handle the process of sending invitations. Each time an invitation is sent, your workflow can:
   
   - Decrement the invitation count on the backend.
   - Update the relationship tuple in OpenFGA with the new, decreased `remaining_invitations`.
   
   For example, if `alice` uses one invitation, your Camunda process will know that her new count is 4. You then call the FGA API to rewrite the tuple condition:
   ```js
   await fgaClient.write({
     writes: [
       {
         user: "user:alice",
         relation: "can_invite",
         object: "application:my_app",
         condition: {
           name: "has_invitations_left",
           context: { "remaining_invitations": "4" }
         }
       }
     ]
   });
   ```
   
   Over time, these updates would continue: `4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0`.

4. **Frontend Checks**:  
   On the frontend, when a user tries to send an invitation, the client application can issue a `check` request to OpenFGA:
   ```js
   const { allowed } = await fgaClient.check({
       user: 'user:alice',
       relation: 'can_invite',
       object: 'application:my_app'
     });
   
   // If allowed is true, show the "Send Invitation" button.
   // If allowed is false, disable the "Send Invitation" button.
   ```
   
   Note that for this particular condition, the value of `remaining_invitations` is fully maintained on the backend side (persisted in the relationship tuple). When you do a check, the persisted context in OpenFGA already includes the current `remaining_invitations`. If `remaining_invitations` is 0, `allowed` will return `false`.

5. **How This Work?**  
   OpenFGA’s conditional tuples can enforce conditions at authorization check time. By coupling your invitation logic to these conditions:
   
   - **Camunda** updates the condition context after each invitation is sent (or any other business logic event).
   - **OpenFGA** enforces that the user can only perform the action (e.g., send invitations) if the condition (`remaining_invitations > 0`) is met.
   - **Frontend** performs a check before enabling or showing the invitation action. If `allowed` returns `false`, the user can’t proceed.
   
   As a result, you have a real-time, centralized way of controlling whether users can send further invitations, all driven by dynamic authorization conditions rather than hardcoded logic on the frontend or separate backend checks.
